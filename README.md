# Chess-diagram-recognition

Detect and identify a 2D chessboard and the configuration of its pieces through the  
application of image processing.  

## :page_facing_up: Description
First, we need to load image:

Next job is to extract 2D diagram:

Than, we will divide the diagram into 64 squares,  
and identify each piece:
